# Misc-Scripts

Right now, contains installations scripts for [Arch Linux][1] and [Gentoo][2].
Please only use if:

- You're comfortable with using scripts that are:
  - a work in progress
  - from someone random on the internet
- You have already done non-graphical installations a few times.
- You are comfortable debugging bash scripts

Currently the top priority is clarity, after that its sanity.
So while `wifi-menu` is easier to use, I have been bitten by it too many times, and prefer using `wpa_supplicant` directly instead.

I still don't have the use case for these scripts well defined.
